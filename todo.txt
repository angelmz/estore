# Need a Multi Transaction Function
1. Create Product (no, images, tags)
2. Create images
4. Add images to products. 
5. Create tags
6. Add tags to products. 


What if user doesn't want to add any tags or images? 
What if he wants use some of his old photos? In this case,
Images would be many to many, but they'd have to be created first?
